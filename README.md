# Assembly_Clock_Design
Utilizes assembly language, a low-level programming language, to implement clock functionality, demonstrating a strong understanding of hardware-level programming and system architecture.

This repository contains an assembly program that simulates a clock and updates its display based on the current time. The program is divided into three main functions, each handling a specific part of the clock's functionality. The code demonstrates low-level programming techniques, including bit manipulation, arithmetic operations, and memory management.

Demonstrates:
Low-Level Programming: Demonstrates the use of assembly language for precise control over hardware and memory.

Time Conversion: Converts raw time data (in seconds) into hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM.

Display Update: Updates a simulated clock display using bitwise operations and masks.

Error Handling: Includes checks for invalid time values and handles errors gracefully.
